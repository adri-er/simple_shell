.SH NAME
shell_Name - command interpreter (shell)

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B ./shell_name [command_1] [command_2] ...
.PP
.B ./shell_name
.PP
.B [command_1] [command_2] ... | ./shell_name

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BD -filled
Shell_Name is a command interpreter based on many of the functionalities of BASH (sh). The current
version of Shell_Name is in process of being upgraded to conform more features.
.ED

.SS Overview
.BD -filled
Shell_Name is a command interpreter that will read lines from the standard input file or will
interpret them from arguments of the terminal. Usually a shell is a program that is running when
a system starts, nevertheless the shell used can be changed. In the case of the Shell_Name the
features incorporated are the same in the interactive or non-interactive mode. Shell_Name implements
control constructs, macro facilities, built in history and line editing characteristics as part of
its language.
.ED

.SS Invocation
.BD -filled
In Shell_Name if no arguments are present and if the standard input is connected to a terminal, it is
considered that the interactive mode is implemented. An interactive shell will only need a call at first
and since then it will print a prompt and wait for a command to execute. In this case the shell treats the
first argument as the name of the file from which to read commands. On the other hand, if the shell gets
runned with arguments or as a pipe, the non-interactive mode is entered and after the command executes,
the program exits.
.ED

.SS Quoting
.BD -filled
Shell_Name uses quoting as a feature in which a special character or word meaning is ignored. For example,
it can be implemented with operators, whitespace or keywords. Quoting can be done with single quotes,
double quotes and backslash. 
.ED

.PP
.BD -filled
Backslash preserves the literal meaning of the next character, except for the newline character.
.ED

.PP
.BD -filled
Single Quotes preserves the literal meaning of characters enclosed in single quotes, except for single quotes.
.ED

.PP
.BD -filled
Double Quotes preserves the literal meaning of characters enclosed in double quotes, except for the characters
dollarsign($), backquote(`) and backslash(\(rs).
.ED

.PP
.BD -filled
Reserved words are words that the shell set aside with a special meaning. These words are !, elif, fi, while, case,
else, for, then, }, {, do, done, until, if, esac.
.ED

.SS Commands
.BD -filled
Shell_Name interprets the words it reads according to a specific language, it manages the word as a command after it
validates that is not a reserved word.
.ED

.PP
.BD -filled
Simple commands are just one of the types a shell can have, in Shell_Name most features are directed to them. These are
processed by first striping off leading words that have a value equal to a name, and operators with their arguments.
Afterwards, words are expanded and the first is taken as command name and is used to locate the command. While the rest 
are taken as arguments of the command. complex commands are a combination of simple commands with control operators or
reserved words.
.ED

.SS Search and Execution
.BD -filled
As it was mentioned there are three types of commands: shell functions, builtin commands and normal programs. In this 
same order Shell_Name searches for the type and does an specific execution depending on the type.
.ED

.PP
.BD -filled
When it is a shell function, all the positional parameters are set as arguments of the function. Variables in the
command are made local to the function and values given are set. Afterall, the commans is executes and all values
changed are restored to the original values. Meanwhile, shell builtins are commands executed internally without 
creating a new process. At last, if the command didn't match any of the previous, the executable file is searched
in the system within the path.
.ED

.PP
.BD -filled
A path search is a check through the routes indicated by the environment variable in look for the location of the
executable file of the command of interest.   
.ED

.SS Commands Exit Status
.BD -filled
The exit status of commands in Shell_Name are 0 in the success or normal case and any other value for error or 
failure cases.
.ED

.SS Variables and Parameters
.BD -filled
The shell uses a set of parameters, in many cases denoted as a variable. When Shell_Name starts it turns all the 
environment variables into shell variables. Variables can be created following the form name = value, in which the
name must consist of alphabetic, numeric and underscores.
.ED

.SS Special Parameters
The special parameters that make part of the shell are listed next:

.IP *
Expands to positional parameter to a single field.
.IP @
Expands to positional parameter as a separate argument.
.IP #
Expands to the number of positional parameters.
.IP ?
Expands to the exit status of most recent pipeline.
.IP -
Expands to the current option flags.
.IP $
Expands to process ID of invoked shell.
.IP !
Expands to process ID of most recent background command.
.IP 0
Expands to name of shell or shell script.

.SS Builtins
.BD -filled
In the following list, the builtin commands implemented are listed, these commands have in common that
they perform an operation that can't be done by a separate process.
.ED

.IP exit
Terminates the shell process.
.IP env
Prints all the environment variables followed as a list.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.BD -filled
Shell_Name exits only in the case the exit command is executed if it is in the interactive mode. In any other case
the shell exits when it finished executing the command or an error is detected.
.ED

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.BD -filled
Shell_Name environment variables are the same ones used by bash shell, these are listed below. For more information
about the values each have, the bash manual has an extensive description of each.

.PP

.SH BUGS
Shell_Name operates without any problem simple commands, for else, any attempt to implement a complex command
can cause undesired results. If when its implemented there is any case not reaching the desired results, authors
are open to solve doubts and receive feedback.
